# DRIVER-DROWSINESS-DETECTION
In recent years, road accidents caused by driver drowsiness have become a significant concern for traffic safety authorities worldwide. The alarming statistics associated with drowsy driving have prompted researchers and engineers to develop innovative solutions to mitigate this issue and enhance road safety. Among these solutions, the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has gained considerable attention due to their ability to extract meaningful features from visual data.

Driver drowsiness detection using CNNs is a cutting-edge technology that aims to identify signs of drowsiness or fatigue in drivers based on facial expressions and eye movements. By leveraging the power of deep learning algorithms, this system can accurately analyze real-time video feeds from in-car cameras and alert drivers when their attention wanes, providing them with a timely reminder to take necessary measures and prevent potential accidents.

This introduction provides an overview of the significance of driver drowsiness detection, highlights the capabilities of CNNs, and outlines the potential benefits of implementing this technology in vehicles.
